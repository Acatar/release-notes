###Adding Users - Roster Bug Fix

* When a user was added to via the roster in a course, an error would occur if their profile was selected before it was created.

* Max file size is 500 MB and timeout is now set to 30 minutes.

###Profile - Avatar Edit Update

* The 'Edit' overlay on the Avatar within a profile will be static so that it is more obvious how to update it.

* The logo on the dashboard has been updated so that there is more padding between the logo and the boarders of the space.

###Course Access - Safari Incognito Mode Bug Fix

* Users were unable to access the ALE when using the Safari in incognito mode, this has been corrected.

* User administration search has been updated to include advanced search options

###User Administration - Default Tenant Groups
