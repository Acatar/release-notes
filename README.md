### Versioning
If you're curious what the version numbers mean, read on...

We use [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org), and the release notes are named by the version. For example, the release notes for version `4.2.0` can be found in `4.2.0.md`.

The first number, `4`, represents the major version. This only changes when we release a breaking change, which doesn't occur very often.

The second number, `2`, represents the minor version. This is updated any time we release new features.

The last number, `0`, represents a patch. This is updated any time we release a bugfix for the last minor version.
